This is a Mathematicator Framework common library for advance work with
math patterns, tokens and computing. The library is considered as
a sublayer for other tools in Mathematicator Framework.

## Installation

```
composer require mathematicator-core/engine
```

## Features

This package contains set of tools that other [mathematicator-core](https://github.com/mathematicator-core)
packages have in common.

- Basic controllers
- System / common entities (DAOs)
- Translator (helper and common translations)
- Common exceptions
- Common router

## Mathematicator Framework tools structure

The biggest advantage is that you can choose which layer best fits
your needs and start build on the top of it, immediately, without the need
to create everything by yourself. Our tools are tested for bugs
and tuned for performance, so you can save a significant amount
of your time, money, and effort.

Framework tend to be modular as much as possible, so you should be able
to create an extension on each layer and its sublayers.

**Mathematicator framework layers** ordered from the most concrete
one to the most abstract one:
